Introduction
============          
This library contains stub classes for the Nokia JSR-257 extensions API that 
deal with the NFCIP Peer 2 Peer communication. It is used to compile the 
MIDlet, but doesn't actually contain any code.

Building
========
The easiest way to build this project is to use Ant, but also Eclipse can be 
used. We assume that you already have Java 6 installed (OpenJDK is fine). The
library is compiled with Java source compatibility for version 1.4 as that is 
required for code running on Java ME phones.

  $ ant dist

Will generate a JAR file in the "dist" directory ready for use. This library 
can be added to the classpath when compiling Java ME applications. In case you 
use Eclipse (MTJ) you can add it as a library belonging to the phone, and not 
as a library for the project!

Using
=====
This library implements the Nokia JSR 257 Extensions API. Documentation on how
to use it can be found online at different sources (and in the Nokia 
documentation belonging to the SDK).
